  "CONTENT": "<p>Technology and social interactions are the two fundamental pillars of my professional life. Not as opposing concepts, but as complementary ones. Just to give a few examples, <h>my enthusiasm for technology</h> grew by participating in <h>hardware forums and their communities</h>. And my notions of <h>leadership</h> are deeply influenced by <h>tango</h>, which, coincidentally, I started dancing in a seminar at my engineering school. I perceive technology through this <h>intersectional perspective</h>.</p><p>In my opinion, technology is one of the drivers of social change. Whether that change is for the better depends on us, those who work with it. Thatâ€™s why <h>we need more diverse and inclusive software development</h>. One that seeks to solve real life issues and focuses on collaboration. This is reflected in my preference for projects that <h>generate a positive impact</h> on their users and <h>promote team culture</h>. And I know that positive change is possible.</p><p>After the pandemic, I split my time between Argentina, Italy, and Germany. What initially seemed like a challenge turned into incredible flexibility. Throughout my recent projects, I had the opportunity to <h>work remotely, asynchronously, and independently of my location</h>, without sacrificing team spirit or productivity.</p><p>For those of us who have loved ones on both sides of the Atlantic, working like this allows us to be where we want or need to be.<br><h>That is technology in the service of people.</h><br>That is what I want to achieve.</p><p>So tell me, <h><i>what is your tech utopia?</i></h></p>",
