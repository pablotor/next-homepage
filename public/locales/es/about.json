  "CONTENT": "I describe myself as a developer and project manager, but fundamentally, I consider myself a problem-solver. I'm always eager to learn new skills and try a different approach.\nMy career path has led me through big multinational companies, little startups and my own ventures, giving me the ability to adapt quickly to new roles and responsibilities. I appreciate the challenges and perks that each working environment brought with it.\nThrough these diverse experiences, I've had the pleasure of being part of fantastic technical teams, both big and small, where collaboration and being a team player was always a key part.\nI believe that technology can play a big part in social transformation, improving the life quality of people all around the world. Therefor, I advocate for free software, accessibility and sustainability. Less, but better.\nCurrently, I'm diving into three different areas: DeFi, for its potential, Rust, for its applications in low level software, and website accessibility, to make the internet a better place."
